On this page, I will link all the weeks and maybe a brief description/evaluation of each week.

** [[id:20251228T131932.226837][Week 0]]

Starting ahead of plan, so that I get a few extra days. Totally unnecessary and gives me no real advantages, but it makes me feel better.

Here's the progress and planning I made before the "pause".

** Pause

There has been a pause/delay in my progress for a number of weeks, due to personal and work reasons. I will be trying my best to catch up and continue this journey.

** Week 4 ( and *going forward* )

Instead of documenting my progress in week numbers like how I originally planned. I think that
it may be better to simply use this page as sort of a "project journal".

I will add "dated entries" with brief summary of what I've worked on and link to any relevant notes.
