This plan is design with my current life circumstances in mind - working 20 hours and other things that are more private. I have also taken into consideration related skills and experiences that I already process.

I will also be documenting my progress as well as what I learn here.

* PHASE 1 - The Foundation and Certification
=WEEKS 1 - 4=
** Week 1 - The Enterprise Linux Gap
This is where I will be bridge the knowledge gap between personal Linux and enterprise Linux.

*** [ ] Install a RHEL-based distro

* PHASE 2

* PHASE 3
