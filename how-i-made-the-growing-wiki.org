This website is essentially my notebook that's kept in the open for everyone and anyone to see. I treat this as something like an [[https://obsidian.md/][Obsidian]] vault.
The only difference being that it's public. I designed it to be this way to keep it as simple as possible, to reduce the friction to write and publish.

My workflow is something like:

#+begin_center
=Write / Edit → Sync → Publish=
#+end_center

The underlined tools and programmes that I use are:
+ [[id:20251215T161118.828881][Emacs]] ( [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom Emacs]] ) :: For editing =.org= files, which is the base file format.
+ [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][Ox-Hugo]] :: For exporting =.org= files to =.md= files. 
+ [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]] :: Static site generator, or /"The world's fastest framework for building websites"/.
+ Git ( and currently [[https://github.com][GitHub]] ) ::  For version control and syncing remotely.
+ [[https:www.cloudflare.com][Cloudflare]] :: For domain management and hosting.
