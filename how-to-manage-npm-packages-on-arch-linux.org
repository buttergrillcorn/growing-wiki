* What to avoid!

Avoid using =sudo= with =npm= to install packages as this can lead to permission issues, security risks and conflicts with the =pacman= package manager.

* The "correct" methods
** Method 1 - Use a Version Manager

The first method is to use something like =fnm= ([[https://github.com/Schniz/fnm][Fast Node Manager]]) or =nvm= ([[https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm][Node Version Manager]]).

These will allow you to install multiple versions of Node.js for development without the use of root privileges. Everything will be contained in your =$HOME= directory.

So if you're on Arch Linux, you can install the managers using =pacman= like:

#+begin_src bash
sudo pacman -S fnm
# or pacman -S nvm
#+end_src

You will then have to set up your shell, in my case =~/.zshrc=, like:

#+begin_src bash
eval "$(fnm evn --use-on-cd)"
#+end_src

And finally, install Node:

#+begin_src bash
fnm install --latest
#+end_src
