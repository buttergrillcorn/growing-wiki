## The Enterprise Virtualization Stack {#the-enterprise-virtualization-stack}

I will need to set up my instance of Virtual Machine in a way that sort of replicates a professional enterprise environment as closely as possible.

So instead of using a third-party application like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), I will instead go for the native Linux vitalisation stack.


### Components for the stack {#components-for-the-stack}

-   [KVM ( Kernel-based Virtual Machine )](/kvm-kernel-based-virtual-machine/#what-is-it)
-   QEMU
-   Libvirt
-   Virt-manager
