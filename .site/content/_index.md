## The Garden {#the-garden}

<a id="code-snippet--Garden"></a>
```cfg
garden:
  🌱 state: growing
  🌿 soil: fertile
  🌤 weather: unpredictable
  🧑‍🌾 tending: best_effort
  🧭 mode: exploratory
```

<div class="verse">

This is **NOT** polished content. <br />
This is **NOT** a blog. <br />
This is a **W-I-P** [^fn:1] you can wander through and explore.<br />
