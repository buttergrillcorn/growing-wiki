## Description {#description}

This is my personal notes wiki, using the working in public / digital garden methodology.

Built with:

-   Org mode for writing
-   org-id for unbreakable links
-   ox-hugo for export
-   Hugo + Little Ocean theme for publishing


### Navigation {#navigation}

-   Press `SPC n n` to find or create a note
-   Press `SPC n G` to search all notes
-   Press `SPC n I` to insert a link
-   Press `SPC n b` to see backlinks


### Workflow {#workflow}

1.  Write notes in Org mode
2.  Save automatically exports to Hugo via ox-hugo
3.  Git commits and pushes automatically (enabled by default)
4.  Website updates on Cloudflare Pages

Toggle auto-sync with `SPC n A` if you prefer manual control.

Start writing your first note!
