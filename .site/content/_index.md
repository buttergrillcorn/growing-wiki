## To my Growing Wiki {#to-my-growing-wiki}

This is my personal notes wiki, using the [learning in public](/learning-in-public/#what-does-learning-in-public-mean) / [digital garden](/digital-garden/#what-is-a-digital-garden) method.
This is an **always growing** collection of all my notes, ideas, thoughts and experiments that I want to share with the world, with you.

<div class="verse">

This is **NOT** polished content. <br />
This is **NOT** a blog. <br />
This is a **W-I-P** [^fn:1] you can wander through and explore.<br />

</div>


### "Why?" {#why}

The original idea sprouted quite a while back. I would say ever since I have encountered Logseq, Obsidian and the idea of Zettelkasten.

I loved the idea of retaining knowledge through note taking and collection of information.


## how the website is built: {#how-the-website-is-built}


### tools that i use {#tools-that-i-use}

-   org mode for writing

### my note taking workflow {#my-note-taking-workflow}

1.  write notes in org mode
2.  save automatically exports to hugo via ox-hugo
3.  git commits and pushes automatically (enabled by default)
4.  website updates on cloudflare pages

toggle auto-sync with `spc n a` if you prefer manual control.
