## Welcome to Growing Wiki  🌱 {#welcome-to-growing-wiki}

This is my personal notes wiki, using the [working in public](/working-in-public/#what-does-working-in-public-mean) / [digital garden](/digital-garden/#what-is-a-digital-garden) method.
It is essentially an **always growing** collection of all my notes, ideas, thoughts and experiments that I want to share with the world, with you.

<div class="verse">

It is **NOT** polished content; <br />
It is **NOT** a blog; <br />
It is a **W-I-P** you can wander through and explore.<br />
