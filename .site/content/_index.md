## 🌱 Welcome to Growing Wiki {#welcome-to-growing-wiki}

This is my personal notes wiki, using the [working in public](/working-in-public/#what-does-working-in-public-mean) / [digital garden](/digital-garden/#what-is-a-digital-garden) methodology.


## How the website is built: {#how-the-website-is-built}


### Tools that I use {#tools-that-i-use}

-   Org mode for writing
-   org-id for unbreakable links
-   ox-hugo for export
-   Hugo + Little Ocean theme for publishing


### My note taking workflow {#my-note-taking-workflow}

1.  Write notes in Org mode
2.  Save automatically exports to Hugo via ox-hugo
3.  Git commits and pushes automatically (enabled by default)
4.  Website updates on Cloudflare Pages

Toggle auto-sync with `SPC n A` if you prefer manual control.

Start writing your first note!
