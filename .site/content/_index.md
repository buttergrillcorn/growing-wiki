## Welcome to Growing Wiki  🌱 {#welcome-to-growing-wiki}

This is my personal notes wiki, using the [working in public](/working-in-public/#what-does-working-in-public-mean) / [digital garden](/digital-garden/#what-is-a-digital-garden) method.
It is essentially an **always growing** collection of all my notes, ideas, thoughts and experiments that I want to share with the world, with you.

> It is **NOT** polished content; <br />
> It is **NOT** a blog; <br />
> It is a **work-in-progress** you can wander through and explore.


## How the website is built: {#how-the-website-is-built}


### Tools that I use {#tools-that-i-use}
