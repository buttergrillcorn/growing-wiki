## What this is {#what-this-is}

This is my dotfiles for my Linux laptop using Emacs, org files and tangling, with Stow to symlink them.

The dotfiles.org was getting too large and harder to handle for AI agents.

So I have moved Doom config out of dotfiles.org into doom.org for easier indexing and searching. Can you make sure that it is able to tangle properly with the tangle.sh script like dotfiles.org is.

I will be dividing the dotfiles.org


## What needs fixing {#what-needs-fixing}

-   Links to heading are not recognised (ID links)
-   SPC n s (searching) is not working. No result shows.
-   Hugo related heading metadata isn't generated and added.
