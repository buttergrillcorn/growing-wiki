## What needs fixing {#what-needs-fixing}

-   Links to heading are not recognised (ID links)
-   SPC n s (searching) is not working. No result shows.
-   Hugo related heading metadata isn't generated and added.


## Method {#method}

Try and separate the Doom config out of the dotfiles.org for better indexing and searching. Make sure that it's still tangled with the tangle.sh script

Simplify the approach without losing function, make sure that the code is properly re-evaluated.

Remove any redundant code blocks.
