## Navigation {#navigation}

As the name suggests, this place is almost like a "[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki)". Hyperlinks are used heavy to navigate you around the garden. It is encouraged to click on links you find interesting and wander around freely.


### Previews {#previews}

Hover your mouse/cursor over any internal links will show you a preview pop-up of the page.&nbsp;[^fn:1]


### Scroll-able pages {#scroll-able-pages}

As you may have noticed, opening a new page will spawn it in an ever-growing list that you can scroll through.

This is very helpful for maintaining context and knowing how you arrived at the page.


### Backlinks {#backlinks}

A backlink section is present at the bottom of every note.
This extends our option for exploration, particularly in related notes and concepts.


### Search {#search}

Clicking on the `search` button at the top of the site will toggle a search box for you to search through all my notes,
However, this is not prioritised as a primary method of navigating around the website as the capabilities are quite limited (currently).

When you search for a keyword/query, you are able to see a list of notes with only their name and growth level being displayed.

Currently, there are no hint or guidance on where the keyword/query is mentioned in the note(s). You may only know that the note(s) is related and not the extent of it.

This encourages exploration of your own so I am not planning on implementing any advanced features, at least yet.

[^fn:1]: This likely does **not** work on (mobile) touch devices unfortunately.
