## What {#what}

This is my attempt at growing my own [Digital Garden](/digital-garden/#content) and [learning in public](/learning-in-public/#content).

-   Rough ideas
-   Unfinished notes
-   Attempted writings
-   Brewing thoughts

Rather a W.I.P that is constantly evolving and **growing**, for the sake of always <span class="underline">learning</span>.

I also find it super helpful to "grow" and "cultivate" my thoughts and ideas when trying to share it with a friend. It's very reminiscent of the rubber duck method. But instead of talking to a rubber duck, I choose to scream into the void of internet, to you.

The idea of sharing my notes and learning with the internet wasn't actually a recent thought. I came across such concepts ever since the discovering of productivity tools like Logseq and Obsidian.

Not ashamed to share this, this is not my first attempt at it.
