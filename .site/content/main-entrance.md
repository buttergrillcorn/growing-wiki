## What is it? {#what-is-it}

This is my attempt at growing my own [Digital Garden](/digital-garden/#content) and [learning in public](/learning-in-public/#content).

In this ever-growing garden, you will find things like:

-   Rough ideas
-   Unfinished notes
-   Attempted writings
-   Brewing thoughts

The point is **not** to have a highly polished final piece to showcase;

Rather a W.I.P that is constantly evolving and **growing**, for the sake of always <span class="underline">learning</span>.
