## What {#what}

This is my attempt at growing my own [Digital Garden](/digital-garden/#content) and [learning in public](/learning-in-public/#content).

In this ever-growing garden, you will find things like:

-   Rough ideas
-   Unfinished notes
-   Attempted writings
-   Brewing thoughts

The point is **not** to have a highly polished final piece to showcase;

Rather a W.I.P that is constantly evolving and **growing**, for the sake of always <span class="underline">learning</span>.


## Why {#why}

Because why not?

On a serious note, I find myself to be a very forgetful person. So to retain the content I consume, ideas that sparkled and notes that I plan on re-visiting; I have longed for a place to store, curate and recall everything.

I also find it super helpful to "grow" and "cultivate" my thoughts and ideas when trying to share it with a friend.
It's very reminiscent of the [rubberducking method](/rubber-duck-debugging/#content). But instead of talking to a rubber duck, I choose to scream into the void of internet, to you.

As for why doing it this way, instead of x ... and more, find out [here](/why-growing-wiki/#content).


## How {#how}

<span class="underline">**[Guide](/garden-guide/#content) for navigating around the garden**</span>

This website is essentially my notebook that's kept in the open for everyone and anyone to see. I treat this as something like an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault.
The only difference being that it's public. I designed it to be this way to keep it as simple as possible, to reduce the friction to write and publish.

My workflow is something like:
`Write / Edit → Sync → Publish`

The underlined tools and programmes that I use are:

[Emacs](/emacs/#content) ( [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) )
: For editing `.org` files, which is the base file format.

[Ox-Hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/)
: For exporting `.org` files to `.md` files.

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
: Static site generator, or _"The world's fastest framework for building websites"_.

Git ( and currently [GitHub](https://github.com) )
: For version control and syncing remotely.

[Cloudflare](https:www.cloudflare.com)
: For domain management and hosting.
