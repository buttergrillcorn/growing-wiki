## What {#what}

This is my attempt at growing my own [Digital Garden](/digital-garden/#content) and [learning in public](/learning-in-public/#content).

In this ever-growing garden, you will find things like:

-   Rough ideas
-   Unfinished notes
-   Attempted writings
-   Brewing thoughts

Rather a W-I-P that is constantly evolving and **growing**, for the sake of always <span class="underline">learning</span>.


## Why {#why}

On a serious note, I find myself to be a very forgetful person. So to retain the content I consume, ideas that sparkled and notes that I plan on re-visiting; I have longed for a place to store, curate and recall everything.
