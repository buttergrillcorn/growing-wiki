## Context {#context}

This plan is design with my current life circumstances in mind - working 20 hours and other things that are more private. I have also taken into consideration related skills and experiences that I already process.

I will also be documenting my progress as well as what I learn here.


## PHASE 1 - The Foundation and Certification {#phase-1-the-foundation-and-certification}

`WEEKS 1 - 4`


### Week 1: The Enterprise Linux Gap {#week-1-the-enterprise-linux-gap}

This is where I will be bridge the knowledge gap between personal Linux and enterprise Linux.

-   [ ] Install a RHEL-based distro ( Set up Rocky Linux or Fedora in a VM )
-   [ ] Master Package Management ( `dnf` or `rpm` instead of `pacman` )
-   [ ] Learn SELinux ( Learn how to check logs and `audit2allow` )
-   [ ] Firewall ( Learn `firewalld` )


### Week 2: Networking Fundamentals {#week-2-networking-fundamentals}

-   [ ] CIDR Notation ( Subnet ranges )
-   [ ] DNS Debugging ( Master `dig` and `nslookup` )
-   [ ] HTTP Status Codes ( Memorise difference between 401/403 and 502/503 )
-   [ ] The Packet Journey ( Be able to explain what happens when you type an address into a browser, e.g. `growing.wiki` )
