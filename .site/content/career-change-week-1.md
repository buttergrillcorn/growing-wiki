## New Beginning {#new-beginning}

<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2026-01-02 Fri]</span></span>

It is officially 2026!

Now, this week's objective is to set up a local VM running Linux, in a secure way.

[Here](/12-weeks-action-plan-for-my-career-change/#week-11-12-interview-drill)'s the link to Week 1 part of my 12 Weeks Plan.

## Continuation of last weeks task {#continuation-of-last-weeks-task}

I was working on [installing and setting up a VM](/setting-up-vm-for-enterprise-environment/#finalisation) on my laptop which runs Arch Linux, using [QEMU](/qemu/#hardware-emulation) and [KVM](/kvm-kernel-based-virtual-machine/#what-is-it).
