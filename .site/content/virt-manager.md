## <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> What is Virt-manager? {#what-is-virt-manager}

Virt-manager or Virtual Machine Manager, is essentially the GUI that the user will be interacting with to
manage the [Libvirt](/libvirt/#security) API.

This means that you can use buttons, sliders and menus instead of writing XML code or long commands.
