## Strategic Application Tips {#strategic-application-tips}

-   ****The M&amp;S Leverage:**** Always highlight your 7 years of service experience in your opening sentence. It proves you are reliable and can handle high-pressure user environments.
-   ****Project over Degree:**** Since you left your degree, lead with your `growing-wiki` and `dotfiles` projects. These prove you have the _skills_ the degree was supposed to teach.
-   ****Remote-First Boards:**** Ensure you have active profiles on [Otta](https://otta.com/) and [Cord](https://cord.co/), as they prioritize technical proficiency and personal projects.
