## Overview {#overview}

On this page, I will link all the weeks and maybe a brief description/evaluation of each week.


### [Week 0](/career-change-week-0/#review) {#week-0--career-change-week-0-dot-md}

Starting ahead of plan, so that I get a few extra days. Totally unnecessary and gives me no real advantages, but it makes me feel better.


### [Week 1](/career-change-week-1/#continuation-of-last-weeks-task) {#week-1--career-change-week-1-dot-md}

Here's the progress and planning I made before the "pause".

---


### Pause {#pause}

There has been a pause/delay in my progress for a number of weeks, due to personal and work reasons. I will be trying my best to catch up and continue this journey.

---


### Week 4 ( and **going forward** ) {#week-4--and-going-forward}

Instead of documenting my progress in week numbers like how I originally planned. I think that
it may be better to simply use this page as sort of a "project journal".

I will add "dated entries" with brief summary of what I've worked on and link to any relevant notes.
