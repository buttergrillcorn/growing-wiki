Link to heading in same file: [[*Tables][Jump to Tables section]]

** External Links

Visit [[https://orgmode.org][Org Mode website]] for documentation.

* Code Blocks

** Inline Code

Use ~git status~ to check repository state.

** Code Block

#+begin_src python
def fibonacci(n):
    """Calculate fibonacci number recursively."""
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Test it
print(fibonacci(10))
#+end_src

** Another Language

#+begin_src elisp
(defun my-function (arg)
  "Example Emacs Lisp function."
  (message "Hello %s!" arg))

(my-function "World")
#+end_src

* Tables

** Simple Table

| Name    | Age | City       |
|---------+-----+------------|
| Alice   |  30 | New York   |
| Bob     |  25 | London     |
| Charlie |  35 | Tokyo      |
| Diana   |  28 | Paris      |

** Table with Alignment

| Left aligned   |   Center |   Right |
| :------------- | :------: | ------: |
| Text           |      123 |    4.56 |
| More text      |      789 |   10.11 |

* Quotes

#+begin_quote
This is a blockquote. It can span multiple lines and is used for citing text or emphasizing important passages.

It supports multiple paragraphs as well.
#+end_quote

* Special Blocks

** Example Block

#+begin_example
This is an example block.
  It preserves formatting.
    Including indentation.
#+end_example

** Verse Block

#+begin_verse
Roses are red
Violets are blue
Org mode is great
And so are you
#+end_verse

* Emphasis and Highlighting

- This has =highlighted text= which should be prominent
- This has ~inline code~ which is different
- This is *bold* and this is /italic/
- This is _underlined_ and this is +strikethrough+

* Images

Example image link (if it exists):

+ :: 
[[file:./images/example.png]]

* Horizontal Rule

Above the line.

-----

Below the line.

* Definition Lists

- Term 1 :: Definition of term 1
- Term 2 :: Definition of term 2 with more details
- Long Term :: This is a longer definition that might wrap to multiple lines to demonstrate how definition lists are rendered

* Checkboxes

- [ ] Unchecked item
- [-] Partially checked item
- [X] Checked item
- [ ] Another unchecked with longer text to see wrapping behavior

* Footnotes

This text has a footnote reference[fn:1].

Here's another reference[fn:test].

* Backlinks Test

This note should show backlinks from any note that links to it. Try creating a link to this test page from another note to see how backlinks appear at the bottom.

* Summary

This page demonstrates all major org-mode syntax elements. Use it to test:

1. Typography and heading styles
2. List formatting
3. Table rendering
4. Code block styling
5. Link behavior
6. Special blocks and quotes
7. Text emphasis and highlighting
8. Backlinks functionality

Check the rendered HTML to ensure everything displays correctly with the org-mode inspired styling.

[fn:1] This is the first footnote.

[fn:test] This is a named footnote with more details.
