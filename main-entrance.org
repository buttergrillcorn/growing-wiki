This is my attempt at growing my own [[id:20251214T182547.516206][Digital Garden]] and [[id:20251214T183616.136892][learning in public]].

In this ever-growing garden, you will find things like:
+ Rough ideas
+ Unfinished notes
+ Attempted writings
+ Brewing thoughts

The point is *not* to have a highly polished final piece to showcase;

Rather a W.I.P that is constantly evolving and *growing*, for the sake of always _learning_.
