* What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is a collection of evolving ideas, unlike a traditional blog:

- Notes are constantly updated and refined
- Ideas are interconnected, not chronological
- Imperfect thoughts are published early
- Knowledge grows organically over time

* Why Work in Public?

Working in public means sharing your notes as you write them:

- Get feedback early and often
- Build connections with like-minded people
- Create a knowledge base others can learn from
- Hold yourself accountable to keep learning

* Key Principles

** Embrace Imperfection

Don't wait for notes to be "ready" - publish drafts, rough ideas, and incomplete thoughts. The value is in the process, not just the final product.

** Link Liberally

Connect related ideas using org-id links. These links never break, even when you rename files or reorganize.

** Iterate Continuously

Return to notes and expand them as you learn more. Digital gardens are living documents, not static posts.
