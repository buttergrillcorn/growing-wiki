* The Enterprise Virtualization Stack 
:PROPERTIES:

:END:

I will need to set up my instance of Virtual Machine in a way that sort of replicates a professional enterprise environment as closely as possible. 

So instead of using a third-party application like [[https://www.virtualbox.org/][VirtualBox]], I will instead go for the native Linux virtualisation stack.

** Components for the stack

+ [[id:20251228T134122.543389][KVM ( Kernel-based Virtual Machine )]] - Handles the heavy lifting of CPU and memory
+ [[id:20251228T190207.612738][QEMU]] - The "hands and feet" of the VM, providing the emulated hardware ( think USB ports and network cards, etc )
+ [[id:20260102T200157.820374][Libvirt]] - The "engine" or "nervous system" of the VM; The API that controls the brain and body.
+ [[id:20260102T202529.710382][Virt-manager]] - The "user interface" you interact with. [fn:: This is no longer part of the stack after [[id:20260102T205351.258562][consideration]]]
  
* Infrastructure Setup

I will be using =virt-install= to ensure the environment is reproducible.

#+begin_src bash
virt-install \
    
#+end_src
